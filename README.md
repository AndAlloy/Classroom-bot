# Classroom-bot
This is project for my educational purposes.

Stack: Python 3.10.

Frameworks and tools: Aiogram (>2.16), SQLAlchemy (>1.4.27), PostgreSQL.

Need to setup "TOKEN" environmental variable (Telegram token).
For now it only supports adding lessons and displaying the schedule.
Two subgroups for class are available (but can be modified up to infinity).

Non-important project, very rare updates.

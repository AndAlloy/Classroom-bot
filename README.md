# Classroom-bot
This is project for my educational purposes.

Stack: Python 3.10.

Frameworks and tools: Aiogram (>2.16), SQLAlchemy (>1.4.27), PostgreSQL.

For now it only supports adding lessons and displaying the schedule.
Two subgroups for class are available (but can be modified up to infinity).

Non-important project, very rare updates.
